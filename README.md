# WordGuessCPP

### This is a simple word guess game that demonstrates basic Object Oriented Programming concepts in C++. Its dependencies are C++11 and CMake 2.8.9. If you are running this on an environment that came out later than 2011, you should have no problem running it.

# To build this, do the following on a Linux/MacOS terminal:
```
git clone "https://github.com/irvingrivas/WordGuessCPP"
cd WordGuessCPP
cmake .
make
./WordGuess
```
