# C++ Word Guess

### This is a simple word guess game that demonstrates basic Object Oriented Programming concepts in C++. Its dependencies are C++11 and CMake 3.1.0. If you are running this on an environment that came out later than 2011, you should have no problem running it.

# To build this, do the following on a Linux/MacOS terminal or Windows Command Prompt (hopefully with bash installed):
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/irvingrivas/WordGuessCPP"
cd WordGuessCPP
cmake .
make
./WordGuess
```
* You play the game by guessing a letter of a random word.
* If you guess right, the letter is filled into the random word.
* Once you type in all the letters that comprise the word, you win!
